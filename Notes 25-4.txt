What is constructor?
1. If a class name and method name are same , the method is called as constructor.
2. Constructor also a kind of method.
3. Cons should be public
4. Cons should not return any value.
5. we can't call a cons.
6. If u try to call , it will return error.
7. Whenever we create an object to a class, the constuctor automaticalled invoked.
8. Constructor can be overloaded.
9. Types :
1. default
2. parameterized
3. private
4. static
   1. should be only one static constructor
   2. static cons should be default , not as parameterized
  3. there is no any access specifier to static const.
  4. C# supports static and instance constructor.
  5. Stattic cons are convient, but they are slow
  6. Non static const is inline as well as its fast.

5. copy
if we create a new object and want to copy the values from existing object we can use copy constructor.
This constructor takes a single argument.
It follows th reference to copy constructor.

6. Constructor chaining


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polymorphism - can create function/ constructor / method in  Same name with diff parameter or datatype or order of parameter, so we can use in different form

1. Static
   1. function/ constructor / method overloading 
	rules - (Return type , access specifier  ans storage classes wont consider in overloading)
   2. Operator Overloading

2. Dynamic
   1. Overriding
