OOPS -
It has basic 8 concepts
1. Class
	  Its a user defined datatype. can create member methods (function) and member variables(normal variable)  in a class.

	Two types of class 1. user defined  2. predefined 
	In C# all class should within Namespace (Nothing but a project name. similar to folder.)

2. Object
    we can access member variable/method thru the object. 
    The object use . Notation
   We can create N no of objects to a class.
   we can communication between different object.
  New is a operator key word . It is used to create instance to a object . 
   Instance holds the reference of a class.

3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
6. Inheritance
7. Dynamic binding
8. Message passing

If any langs supports the above concepts, that kind of langs are called OOPL.

1. Features
	1. Can use real world things
	2. Resilece to Change
	3. Reusablity
---------------------------------------------------------------
Access Specifier
1. We can set visibility control to a class/method/variable by using access specifier
2. private, public, protected, internal, protected internal
3. Internal is the default access specifier in C sharp (private is the default access specifier in C Plus Plus)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Class
1. Abstract class - cannot create an instance to a abstract. by inheritance only can use.'
2. Sealed class - opposite of abstract class. We cannot inerit a sealed class. So we have to create instance to use.
3. static class - can use static keyword before a class, method, variable. We no need to create object to access static variable and methods. A static method can use only static variable.
4. Nested class -
